/**
 * Picking a destination folder.
 *
 * Move and copy both need a path relative to the library root, and typing one
 * is only reasonable if you already know it. This offers the folders that
 * actually exist as a menu, and keeps the text field beside it: the list comes
 * from a library's indexed folders, so a path that has never held a file is not
 * in it, and a dropdown on its own would make those destinations unreachable.
 *
 * The menu is a plain <select> of flattened paths rather than a tree widget.
 * That is one control instead of five, it inherits keyboard and screen-reader
 * behaviour for free, and the slash-separated paths carry the hierarchy.
