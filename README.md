# Cairn

> A small, beautiful, personal digital place that quietly organizes everything you want to keep.

Cairn is a self-hosted personal media, file, and memory server. It brings together
ideas from Google Photos, Google Drive, Obsidian, and personal digital archives into
one calm, self-hosted application.

The most important architectural idea:

> **Cairn catalogs and manages existing media *in place*. It never copies, moves,
> recompresses, or rewrites your original files.**

Your filesystem is the source of truth for actual media files. Point Cairn at a
directory full of years of photos and videos and it indexes them where they are.

## Current status

v1.0 — feature-complete. Phases 0–22 are merged to `main` (see
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)), including storage libraries, the
incremental indexer, media processing, file browsing, search, memories,
albums/tags, resource-based authorization, sharing, backups, optional local ML,
face recognition, duplicate detection, and the web file-browser + organization
UI.

The foundation is in place:

- Go API server with clean package boundaries
- SQLite with WAL, migrations, and a pure-Go driver (cross-compiles without CGO)
- Embedded React + TypeScript frontend (built into a single binary)
- Health, version, and authentication endpoints with consistent JSON error
  envelopes and request IDs
- User accounts (argon2id password hashing), HTTP-only session cookies,
  Admin/User roles, and audit logging
- Configuration via environment variables
- Build system (`Makefile`), container image, and CI
- Documentation and architecture decision records

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the full plan.

## Quick start

### From source

```sh
make build          # builds web/, embeds it, compiles bin/cairn
./bin/cairn         # serves http://127.0.0.1:8715
```

The server database and state live in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/cairn`
(`~/.local/share/cairn`). Override with `CAIRN_DATA_DIR`.

### Requirements

- Go and Node (to build from source).
- **ffmpeg** (recommended): Cairn uses it to make video thumbnails. Without it,
  the browser has to decode each video itself, which fails for formats it
  cannot play (for example HEVC/x265 `.mkv`), and those videos show no
  preview. Install it with `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Debian/Ubuntu),
  `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS) or your platform's package manager, and make
  sure it is on `PATH` for the server. Cairn warns in the app when it is missing.

### Docker

The image already includes ffmpeg.

```sh
docker build -t cairn .
docker run -d \
  --name cairn \
  -p 8715:8715 \
  -v cairn-data:/data \
  cairn
```

### Development

```sh
make web-install    # npm install once
make dev            # run the backend (serves web/dist)
make web-dev        # in another terminal: Vite dev server with /api proxy
```

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for details.

### Video timeline preview

Rest the pointer on a video's timeline for a second and a small frame preview
appears above it. It runs entirely in the browser (a second, muted copy of the
video seeks to the hovered time); the server is not involved. Things you may
notice:

- **No preview for some videos.** It needs a format the browser can decode. If
  the browser cannot show the video's picture (HEVC/x265 on most Linux
  browsers, some exotic `.mkv` codecs), the preview never appears. The video
  may still play with sound only.
- **The time is approximate.** The seek bar is the browser's own control, so
  Cairn estimates where it is from the pointer position. Chrome, Firefox and
  Safari lay it out slightly differently, so the previewed frame can be off by
  a few seconds and the popup may show when you are not exactly on the bar.
- **Fullscreen.** It works in Cairn's fullscreen (the viewer's full-screen
  button or `F`). The browser's own native video fullscreen button covers the
  page, so no preview is shown there.
- **No preview on touch screens.** Phones and tablets have no hover.
- **A short delay.** The preview waits one second, then needs time to seek:
  typically 0.1–0.5 s, but a second or more for videos with long gaps between
  keyframes or whose index sits at the end of the file (some phone and
  screen-recording clips), because the browser must fetch more data first.
- **Extra data.** A second connection to the video is opened the first time you
  hover the timeline, so it reads more of the file while previewing.

## Configuration

All settings use the `CAIRN_` prefix.

## API

The API is REST/JSON under `/api/v1`. It covers health, version, and the
authentication lifecycle (bootstrap, login, logout, current user, and admin
user management). The complete contract is maintained in
[docs/openapi.yaml](docs/openapi.yaml), with prose in [docs/api.md](docs/api.md).
A future client (React Native, desktop, CLI) can be built against the documented
API without reading Go source.
